**Overview of the Projectt**

Project Name:
Basic RESTful API for Resource Management

Objective:
To build a simple yet functional RESTful API that demonstrates the fundamentals of creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) resources using Express.js. The project aims to provide hands-on experience in API design and routing.

Key Features and Functionalities:

Create Resource:

Users can add new resources using POST requests.
The API validates the input before saving the resource.
Read Resource:

Retrieve a list of all resources or a specific resource by its ID using GET requests.
Update Resource:

Modify existing resource details using PUT requests.
Ensures that only valid data is updated.
Delete Resource:

Remove a resource from the collection using DELETE requests.
Error Handling:

Provides meaningful error messages for invalid or missing data.
Technologies Used:

Framework: Express.js (Node.js)
Middleware:
express.json() for parsing JSON requests
Custom error handling middleware
Key Activities:

Setup:

Initialize a Node.js project and install Express.js.
Configure basic middleware for request parsing.
Development:

Implement CRUD routes for managing resources.
Add input validation and error handling.
Testing:

Test all endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL.
Verify proper responses for valid and invalid requests.
Documentation:

Provide endpoint details, including methods, URLs, and required/requested parameters.
Expected Outcomes:

A functional API demonstrating CRUD operations.
Understanding of RESTful principles, routing, and middleware usage.
Knowledge of handling HTTP methods and responses.
